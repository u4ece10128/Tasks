% Create the |VideoWriter| object to open an AVI file for writing. 
vidWriter = VideoWriter('frames.avi');
open(vidWriter);

%% Acquire and store frames
% The following loop writes the acquired frames to the specified AVI file
% for future processing. 

for index = 1:20
    % Acquire frame for processing
    img = snapshot(cam);
    
    % Write frame to video
    writeVideo(vidWriter, img);
end
