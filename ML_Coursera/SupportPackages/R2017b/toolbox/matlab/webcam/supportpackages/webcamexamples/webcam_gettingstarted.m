%% Acquiring a Single Image in a Loop
% This example shows how to use the |snapshot| function to acquire live
% images from USB Webcams.
%
% MATLAB(R) Support Package for USB Webcams provides ability to bring live
% images from any USB Video Class (UVC) compliant Webcam into MATLAB(R).

%% Identifying Available Webcams
% The |webcamlist| function provides a cell array of webcams on the current
% system that MATLAB(R) can access.
camList = webcamlist

%% Set up Connection to Webcam
% A Webcam object represents the connection between MATLAB(R) and the USB
% webcam. To create a connection to the webcam, use the |webcam| function
% and indicate what camera to be connected with. You can specify the camera
% either by name or index as returned by |webcamlist|. This example uses
% the "Logitech HD Webcam C310" camera. Once the connection is established,
% you can access specific property values by using the dot(.) notation. 

% Connect to the webcam.
cam = webcam(1)

%% Preview Video Stream
% To open a Video Preview window, use the |preview| function. The Video 
% Preview window displays the live video stream from the device. 
preview(cam);

%% Acquire a Frame
% To acquire a single frame, use the |snapshot| function.
img = snapshot(cam);

% Display the frame in a figure window.
image(img);

%% Acquiring Multiple Frames
% A common task is to repeatedly acquire a single image, process it, and
% then store the result. To do this, |snapshot| should be called in a loop. 

for idx = 1:5
    img = snapshot(cam);
    image(img);
end

%% Clean up
% Once the connection is no longer needed, clear the associated variable.

clear cam
